## Info

The UCLA Career Center's career fair event pages are long and hard to read, so in an effort to make this information as concise as possible, I provide a simple list of the attending companies and their career websites.

The source code for my scripts are provided in the [source](source) folder; I describe my coding process in more detail there.

The data for these lists are obtained from [here](http://www.career.ucla.edu/Students/Job-Search-Strategies/Fairs-and-Targeted-Events).
